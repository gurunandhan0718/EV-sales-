**EV Sales Data Analysis üìäüîå**

This project focuses on analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help understand the growth and adoption of EVs across different regions and time periods.
üìÅ Project Structure
- `EV_sales_data.csv` ‚Äì The dataset containing EV sales information
- `EV_sales_analysis.ipynb` ‚Äì Jupyter notebook for analysis and visualizations

**üîç Key Objectives**
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify top-selling EV brands and regions
- Analyze year-over-year growth in EV sales
- Visualize trends using Python (matplotlib/seaborn/plotly)

**üìå Tools & Technologies**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau
- Excel (for initial cleaning )

**üöÄ Outcome**
1. **EV Sales Trends & Market Growth**
- Identified yearly sales growth patterns, showing increasing adoption of EVs over time.
- Seasonal analysis revealed high-demand periods, helping businesses align production and marketing efforts.
- Segmented data by vehicle type, showing dominant categories (e.g., two-wheelers vs. four-wheelers).

2. **State-Wise & Regional Insights**
- Identified top-performing states in EV adoption and areas with low penetration requiring policy interventions.
- Compared urban vs. rural EV adoption rates to understand infrastructure needs and charging station requirements.
- Provided state-level sales heatmaps for better visualization of EV market expansion.

3. **Customer Behavior & Purchase Trends**
- Examined factors influencing EV sales, such as government incentives, fuel price fluctuations, and awareness campaigns.
- Analyzed the impact of economic factors, such as income levels and urbanization, on EV adoption.
- Explored consumer preferences by brand and price segment, aiding manufacturers in targeting the right audience.

4. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- Removed anomalies and outliers to ensure accurate sales forecasting.
- Addressed missing values and filtered excessive zero values to prevent model bias.
- Engineered new features such as seasonality effects, policy impact, and economic indicators to enhance model accuracy.

**5. Machine Learning Predictions & Forecasting**
- Built a predictive model to forecast future EV sales with improved accuracy.
- Used regression models and evaluated performance with MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ scores.
- Optimized hyperparameters and selected the best-performing model for accurate predictions.
